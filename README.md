# MoonlightBot Documentation

MoonlightBot is a powerful Discord bot designed to help server moderation without bloat. It features extremely customizable logging, easy to use commands, management of temporary actions, and much much more to make your server life easier. It is very easy to setup and learn its commands.

## Getting started

The first step in using MoonlightBot is to invite it to your server. [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=314110696071888896&permissions=1512298638534&scope=applications.commands%20bot) for a link that lets you invite the bot with all permissions it requires to work.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only servers in which you have **Manage Server** permission will show there.

The bot can still work without its managed role, but some commands may not work if proper permissions are not set.
{% endhint %}

### Commands

MoonlightBot uses Slash Commands. Type a slash (`/`) into the send message box to see all commands.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use `/help <name of a command>` for information on a command.
{% endhint %}

### Configuration

Once the bot is added into the server, you can start using commands straight away.

By default, there's nothing to configure to use the core features, but if you want to set permissions for commands, or log actionsetc, you can edit all of that with the `config` command. A detailed explanation of this command can be found [at the command's page](admin-commands/config/).
